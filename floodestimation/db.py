This module provides a connection with an sqlite database to store (gauged) catchment data including annual maximum flow
data and catchment descriptors.

The database connection usses the `sqlalchemy` package (`docs <sqlalchemy.org>`_) for interaction with a sqlite
database. The module contains a :class:`Base` class that all entities in :mod:`floodestimation.entities` are based on.
This enables straightforward retrieving and saving of data in relevant tables.

The sqlite database is saved in the user's application data folder. On Windows, this is folder is located
at `C:\\\\Users\\\\{Username}\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\OpenÂ Hydrology\\\\fehdata\\\\fehdata.sqlite`.

The database is automatically created (if it does not exist yet) when importing the :mod:`floodestimation` package.

Interaction with the database is typically as follows::

    from floodestimation import db
    from floodestimation.entities import Catchment

    # Once:
    session = db.Session()

    # As and when required:
    session.add(Catchment(...))                           # Load data
    catchments = session.query(Catchment).filter_by(...)  # Retrieve data
    session.commit()

Typically a single session instance can be used throughout a program with commits (or rollbacks) as and when required.
