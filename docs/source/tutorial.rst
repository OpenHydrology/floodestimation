Tutorial and introduction to :mod:`floodestimation`
===================================================

Installation and requirements
-----------------------------

The :mod:`floodestimation` package is available for download on the Python Package Index (PyPI) website. Installation
is straightforward and is typically done like this from a command prompt:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install floodestimation

On Windows `pip` is typically installed under `C:\\Program Files\\Python33\\Scripts\\pip.exe` or somewhere similar.

In case of downloading the package manually, the following other packages are required and must be availabe:

- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `appdirs`
- `sqlalchemy`
- `lmoments3`

Installation packages for `numpy` and `scipy` for Windows are available on the `Unoffical Windows Binaries for Python
Extension Packages website <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gholke/pythonlibs/>`_.

The :mod:`floodestimation` package has been tested with Python 3.3 to 3.4.

Typical workflow
----------------

A typical workflow for using the :mod:`floodestimation` package is as follows:

1. Start with an *ungauged* catchment with catchment details in a `CD3`-file, e.g. `River Dee.CD3`
2. Load the catchment
3. Estimate the median annual flood (QMED)
4. Estimate the flood growth curve
5. Estimate the flood frequency curve
6. Create an analysis report

Estimating QMED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Steps 1 to 3 could be coded as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from floodestimation.loaders import load_catchment
    from floodestimation import db
    from floodestimation.collections import CatchmentCollections
    from floodestimation.analysis import QmedAnalysis

    db_session = db.Session()

    dee_catchment = load_catchment('River Dee.CD3')
    gauged_catchments = CatchmentCollections(db_session)

    qmed_analysis = QmedAnalysis(dee_catchment, gauged_catchments)
    dee_catchment_qmed = qmed_analysis.qmed()

    db_session.close()

Explained step by step:

.. code-block:: python

    db_session = db.Session()

This creates a connection with a sqlite database which will hold data on gauged catchments (catchment descriptors and
annual maximum flow data). The `Session object <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_9/orm/session.html>`_ can be re-used
throughout the program.

.. code-block:: python

    dee_catchment = load_catchment('River Dee.CD3')

This loads the catchment from the `.CD3` file as an :class:`.entities.Catchment` object. See the
`reference manual <entities.html>`_ for a detailed description of all object attributes.

.. code-block:: python

    gauged_catchments = CatchmentCollections(db_session)

This creates a :class:`.collections.CatchmentCollections` object for quick access to gauged catchment
data stored in the database. The **first time**, when the database is still empty, the data will be automatically
downloaded from the `National River Flow Archive website <http://www.ceh.ac.uk/data/nrfa/peakflow_overview.html>`_. This
might take a little while.

.. code-block:: python

    analysis = QmedAnalysis(dee_catchment, gauged_catchments)
    dee_catchment_qmed = qmed_analysis.qmed()

The :class:`.analysis.QmedAnalysis` object provides a comprehensive set of methods to estimate QMED. The library will
automatically identify the best method based on which data is available when calling :meth:`qmed()` without arguments.
The following methods are available:

- Using annual maximum flow records (for gauged catchments)
- Using the Flood Estimation Handbook regression method (`science report SC050050
  <https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/291096/scho0608boff-e-e.pdf>`_) based on
  catchment descriptors and further correction using nearby donor stations (if the gauged catchments
  collection is supplied)
- Emperical estimate using catchment surface area only
- Emperical estimated using the river channel width only

See the `reference manual <analysis.html>`_ for a detailed description how to use the different methods.

Estimating the flood frequency curve
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Step 4 and 5 can be done like this:

.. code-block:: python

    # continue from script above but keep database session open
    # db_session.close()

    from floodestimation.analysis import GrowthCurveAnalysis

    gc_analysis = GrowthCurveAnalysis(dee_catchment, gauged_catchments)
    dee_growth_curve = gc_analysis.growth_curve()
    aeps = [0.5, 0.01, 0.005, 0.001]
    dee_flood_flows = dee_catchment_qmed * dee_growth_curve(aeps)

    for donor in gc_analysis.donor_catchments:
        print("{0:>6} {1:<20s} {2:.3f} {3:.3f}".
            format(donor.id, donor.location, donor.similarity_dist, donor.distance_to(dee_catchment)))

    db_session.close()

Explained step by step:

.. code-block:: python

    gc_analysis = GrowthCurveAnalysis(dee_catchment, gauged_catchments)

Th :class:`.analysis.GrowthCurveAnalysis` provides methods to estimate growth curves for a catchment,
using data from catchment itself or the collection of gauged catchments using a pooling group approach.

.. code-block:: python

    dee_growth_curve = gc_analysis.growth_curve()

Calling the :meth:`.analysis.GrowthCurveAnalysis.growth_curve()` returns a growth curve method/function
which can be used like this: `flow = dee_growth_curve(aep=0.01)`. The method parameter `aep` can be a single annual
exceedance probability (AEP) value or a list of values. If a list of values is provided the returned value is a
:class:`numpy.ndarray` of flows. The growth curve is estimated using one of the following methods:

- Pooling group statistical method: for ungauged catchments (`science report SC050050
  <https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/291096/scho0608boff-e-e.pdf>`_).
  Hydrologically similar catchments are selected from the `gauged_catchments` collection.
- Enhanced single site analysis: for gauged catchments with a record length too small compared with the annual
  exceedance probabilty of interest. (`science report SC050050
  <https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/291096/scho0608boff-e-e.pdf>`_). The
  analysis is similar to the pooling group approach except that the subject catchment has a significantly greater
  weighting in the pooling group than all other catchments.
- Single site analysis: uses flow data from the subject catchment only. This method is not typically used as the record
  length is typicaly too short.

The most suitable method is automatically used, unless the method is specified like this: `growth_curve(method=...)`.
See the `reference manual <analysis.html>`_ for a detailed description how to use the different methods.

.. code-block:: python

    aeps = [0.5, 0.01, 0.005, 0.001]
    dee_flood_flows = dee_catchment_qmed * dee_growth_curve(aeps)

The benefit of the :class:`numpy.ndarray` return type is that we can do element-wise multiplication to obtain the flood
frequency curve.

.. code-block:: python

    for donor in gc_analysis.donor_catchments:
        print("{0:>6} {1:<20s} {2:.3f} {3:.3f}".
            format(donor.id, donor.location, donor.similarity_dist, donor.distance_to(dee_catchment)))

The list of donor catchments used in the analysis can be accessed using the
:attr:`.analysis.GrowthCurveAnalysis.donor_catchments` attribute. This is a simple list of
:class:`.entities.Catchment` objects with an additional attribute :attr:`similarity_dist`.
