"""
This module provides methods to download a complete set of published gauged catchment data from the `National River Flow
Archive <http://www.ceh.ac.uk/data/nrfa/peakflow_overview.html>`_.

Downloaded data files are stored in a Cache folder under the user's application data folder. On Windows, this is folder
is located at `C:\\\\Users\\\\{Username}\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\OpenÂ Hydrology\\\\fehdata\\\\Cache`.

A typical data retrieval is as follows:

>>> from floodestimation import fehdata
>>> fehdata.clear_cache()
>>> fehdata.download_data()
>>> fehdata.unzip_data()

Data files can then be accessed as follows:

>>> cd3_files = fehdata.cd3_files()
>>> amax_files = fehdata.amax_files()

For parsing CD3 files and AMAX files see :mod:`floodestimation.parsers`.
